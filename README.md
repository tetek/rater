##Rater

Is a `UIView` subclass that provides an interface for picking a value from a range.

It's based on design from [Hoang Nguyen](https://dribbble.com/shots/2212678-Version-B).

###Installation

Copy *rater/Rater* directory to your project.

Check out `ViewController.h` to see it in use. I will add demo sometime.
